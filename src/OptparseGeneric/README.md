OptparseGeneric is a decent library, but not worth pursuing further, imho.

 * The difficulty of dealing with general datatypes means the investment in this method is going to run into roadblocks.
 * The help for subcommands is a little clunky.
 * optparse-applicative seems to have features that would be blocked by this.
 * but ultimately, I want to generate UIs instead of command line interfaces.

Conclusion:  learn the type level tricks used here and reapply.  optparse-applicative has completion support, which might be lifted to a UI.
